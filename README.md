#### Brief Description of Project - 

Hotel Peacock Corridor is a hotel located in Lathpandura which pioneers in offering comfortable
lodging facilities, restaurant, and tour facilities to its customers. All the essential features such as
booking, front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, employee management, tours, billing,
invoicing, and reporting are being done manually.
We planned to develop a hotel management system as our project for the second year
Information Technology Project subject at SLIIT. It was a challenging task, but we managed to
accept it. We have planned to manage the activities of the hotel well by considering some of the
major activities that take place. We identified the admin, the customer, the seller, and the
managers of variant departments as the key characters who are active in the system. The system
admin or the relevant manager can be identified as the relevant characters to implement the
system. The functions we have chosen for management are the resource, booking, seller,
inventory, finance, human resource, tour, and catering management. It discusses further
information on the procedure used to set up the system and the technologies used.
The proposed system will ensure both the customers and the employees to have a great
experience and relationship with the hotel. Implementing such a system would prove to be more
cost-effective and time saving for both the hotel and its customers.
